## Introduction


Welcome to the [WCA Live](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org) repository!
Here you can find all the source code that helps to run hundreds of official
WCA competitions a year. Check out the [About](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/about)
page for more background information on where and how this platform is used.

The app is focused on the administrative side of competitions (round management,
entering results, calculating ranking, proceeding competitors from round to round),
as well as the presentation side (displaying round rankings, records, podiums,
real-time updates as results get entered).

## Design

Briefly speaking, WCA Live is a WCA-integrated application composed of a web
client and a GraphQL API server with a relational database behind. Let's break
it down.

### WCA Integration

First of all we use OAuth2 offered by the WCA website, so that users authenticate
with their existing WCA accounts. This plays an important role when it comes to
granting users access to administrative competition tasks, as we can check if the
given user is a delegate, organizer or another staff member at the given competition.

Now to the crucial integration element - data synchronization. At the WCA we developed
a standardized format for exchanging competition data between tools/systems, it's
called [WCIF](https://github.com/thewca/wcif/blob/master/specification.md) (WCA Competition Interchange Format)
and defines a huge JSON object that contains all relevant competition information
(events, rounds, schedule, competitors, results, etc.). The idea behind it is to
have a well defined data format and empower developers to build tools working with
this data (more on that in the [vision](https://github.com/thewca/wcif/blob/master/vision.md)
document). The WCA website offers endpoints for fetching and saving data in this
format and that's exactly what WCA Live uses. When a delegate/organizer imports a
competition into the app, we fetch WCIF data for this competition and save all of
it into the database. Later, competition admins can trigger synchronization, which
works both ways: gets new data from the WCA website saving changes to the local
database, and also sends local changes (like results) to the WCA website. Think of
the WCA website as the source of truth that many tools read from and save data to.
Thanks to this approach delegates/organizers don't have to enter redundant competition
information into WCA Live and can also use/build additional tools to help them run
their competitions.

### Server

The server exposes a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) API allowing the client to fetch
the necessary subset of data and subscribe to real-time updates. It is also responsible
for authenticating users with WCA OAuth and generating PDFs. Under the hood it often
makes requests to the WCA API in order to fetch/save WCIF data, to get regional records
or to list competitions that the current user may import. It also uses a relational
database as a primary source of data.

### Database

The app uses a PostgreSQL database. A bunch of information comes from the WCA website
and is fetched during competition import. We get the data in a heavily nested WCIF
format and we decompose it into relevant tables. Some objects are an inherent part
of their parent object, in which case we just store them in a JSON column (for example
time limit, cutoff and advancement condition in the `rounds` table).

### Client

The client is a web application built with React. It talks to the server via the
GraphQL API. It uses the Apollo library that provides a number of valuable features,
from basic ones like React hooks for querying/mutating data, to more sophisticated
ones like configurable cache with clever updates.

## Development

You need to install Elixir, Node.js, PostgreSQL, as well as `wkhtmltopdf`. Then:

```sh
# Fetch dependencies and create the database
mix setup

# Start the app
mix phx.server

# Run tests
mix test
```

If you're not familiar with Elixir or want a more automated setup, you can use
Docker instead.

### Developing in Docker

Assuming you have Docker and Docker Compose installed, you can start all parts
of the application by running:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This starts the client (on port `3000`), the server (on port `4000`) and the database.
Make sure those ports are free on your machine, so that Docker can bind the relevant
services to them. Running it for the first time builds the docker images and installs
all dependencies, so it may take a while. Subsequent runs should be relatively quick.

Once everything is up and running you should be able to access the app at
[`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000).

Having the containers running you can easily execute custom commands inside them,
just as you'd do on your machine. A few examples:

```sh
# Executing commands in running containers takes the following form:
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec SERVICE COMMAND

# Run server tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app mix test

# Run client tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app npm test --prefix client

# Run the interactive Elixir shell with all the application modules loaded
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec app iex -S mix

# Run the database shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml exec database psql -U postgres wca_live_dev
```

### OAuth during development

In the development environment, instead of interacting with the real WCA server we
talk to the [staging server](https://staging.worldcubeassociation.org). It's similar
to the production one, but used for testing purposes. You can sign into staging via
your actual WCA account and you sign as the matching staging user.

If you have access to any future competition on staging, you can import it.

In the dev environment, there is also a test competition with pre-filled results.
In order to to edit it, you need admin privilages. You can make yourself an admin,
by running the following command, right after you sign in:

```elixir
mix run -e 'import Ecto.Query; from(u in WcaLive.Accounts.User, order_by: [desc: u.updated_at], limit: 1) |> WcaLive.Repo.one!() |> Ecto.Changeset.change(wca_teams: ["wst"]) |> WcaLive.Repo.update!()'
```
